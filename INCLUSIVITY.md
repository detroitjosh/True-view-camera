# Inclusivity Guidelines & Best Practices

## Mission

TrueView Camera exists to create a truly inclusive camera experience that works equally well for everyone, with particular attention to communities that have been historically underserved by imaging technology.

## Core Principles

### 1. Universal Design
- Design for the widest range of people from the start
- Don't retrofit inclusivity - build it in from the beginning
- Consider diverse users in every design decision

### 2. Representation Matters
- Ensure accurate and beautiful representation of all skin tones
- Challenge industry biases in image processing
- Prioritize quality for historically underrepresented groups

### 3. Accessibility for All
- Make the app usable regardless of ability
- Follow accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA minimum)
- Provide alternative interaction methods

### 4. Cultural Sensitivity
- Respect diverse cultural practices and norms
- Avoid assumptions about beauty standards
- Provide customization for individual preferences

## Skin Tone Inclusivity

### The Problem We're Solving

Historically, camera systems have been optimized for lighter skin tones, resulting in:
- **Underexposure** of darker skin tones
- **Loss of detail** in shadows and highlights
- **Color inaccuracy** and unwanted color casts
- **Poor auto-focus** on darker faces

### Our Approach

#### 1. Real Tone Implementation
Based on Google's Real Tone research, we implement:
- **Adaptive exposure compensation**: +0.3 to +0.5 EV for darker skin tones
- **Face detection**: Identify subjects for analysis
- **Skin tone analysis**: Measure and categorize skin tones
- **Local tone mapping**: Preserve details in both highlights and shadows

#### 2. Diverse Testing Dataset
- Test across all Fitzpatrick skin types (I-VI)
- Include various lighting conditions (indoor, outdoor, low-light)
- Test with multiple subjects in the same frame
- Include different age groups, genders, and features

#### 3. Quality Metrics
- **Exposure accuracy**: Within Â±0.3 EV across all skin tones
- **Color accuracy**: deltaE < 5 for all skin types
- **Detail preservation**: SNR > 30 dB for all tones
- **Equal quality**: Types IV-VI match or exceed I-III

#### 4. Continuous Improvement
- Regular testing with diverse images
- Community feedback integration
- Benchmark against industry standards
- Update algorithms based on new research

### Implementation Guidelines for Developers

When working on image processing features:

#### Required Testing
- [ ] Test with Fitzpatrick types I-VI
- [ ] Test with mixed groups (different skin tones in same frame)
- [ ] Test in various lighting (bright, dim, mixed)
- [ ] Measure exposure accuracy
- [ ] Measure color accuracy
- [ ] Get feedback from diverse testers

#### Code Review Checklist
- [ ] Does this maintain quality across all skin tones?
- [ ] Have we tested with diverse sample images?
- [ ] Are there any hardcoded values that assume lighter skin?
- [ ] Does auto-exposure work well for all subjects?
- [ ] Are we measuring fairness metrics?

## Accessibility

### Vision Accessibility

#### Screen Reader Support
- **All UI elements**: Proper accessibility labels
- **Images**: Alternative text descriptions
- **Actions**: Clear announcements for all actions
- **Navigation**: Logical reading order

**Implementation:**
```javascript
<TouchableOpacity 
  accessible={true}
  accessibilityLabel="Capture photo"
  accessibilityHint="Double tap to take a picture"
  accessibilityRole="button"
>
```

#### Visual Accommodations
- **High contrast mode**: Enhanced contrast for UI elements
- **Large text support**: Respect system text size settings
- **Color blindness**: Don't rely solely on color for information
- **Zoom support**: Maintain usability when zoomed

#### Required Standards
- WCAG 2.1 Level AA minimum
- Contrast ratio: 4.5:1 for text, 3:1 for UI components
- Touch targets: Minimum 44x44 points
- Clear focus indicators

### Motor Accessibility

#### Touch Accommodations
- **Large touch targets**: Minimum 44x44 points
- **Spacing**: Adequate space between interactive elements
- **Alternative controls**: Multiple ways to trigger actions
- **No precise gestures**: Avoid requiring exact touch positions

#### Voice Control
- Support iOS Voice Control and Android Voice Access
- Clear voice command labels
- Test with voice-only interaction

### Hearing Accessibility

#### Video Features
- **Captions**: Support for video captions
- **Visual indicators**: Don't rely solely on audio cues
- **Transcripts**: Provide text alternatives for audio content

### Cognitive Accessibility

#### Simple and Clear
- **Clear language**: Avoid jargon and complex terms
- **Consistent UI**: Predictable interface patterns
- **Error prevention**: Clear feedback before destructive actions
- **Help and documentation**: Easy-to-understand guidance

#### Reduced Motion
- Respect system preferences for reduced motion
- Provide alternatives to animations
- Avoid flashing or rapid changes

## Language and Localization

### Internationalization (i18n)

#### Text Handling
- **No hardcoded strings**: All user-facing text in i18n files
- **Cultural formats**: Respect local date, time, number formats
- **Right-to-left (RTL) support**: Support RTL languages (Arabic, Hebrew)

#### Initial Language Support (Planned for v1.1)
- English (en)
- Spanish (es)
- French (fr)
- Mandarin Chinese (zh)
- Arabic (ar)
- Hindi (hi)

#### Translation Guidelines
- **Context**: Provide context for translators
- **Pluralization**: Handle singular/plural correctly
- **Gender**: Avoid gendered language where possible
- **Cultural sensitivity**: Review translations with native speakers

### Cultural Considerations

#### Beauty Standards
- **No single standard**: Don't impose Western beauty norms
- **User choice**: Let users choose their preferences
- **Natural by default**: Enhancements should be subtle and optional
- **Diverse representation**: Show diverse models in documentation

#### Photography Customs
- **Respect privacy**: Different cultures have different photography norms
- **Context awareness**: Consider cultural contexts in feature design
- **Flexible features**: Allow customization for different preferences
