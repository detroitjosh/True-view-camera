# Real-Tone Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the Real-Tone features implemented in TrueView Camera to ensure inclusivity for darker skin tones, based on Google's Real Tone research and the Monk Skin Tone Scale (MST).

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Core Real-Tone Processing Engine

**File**: `src/utils/RealToneProcessor.js`

A comprehensive processing engine that implements:

- **Monk Skin Tone Scale (MST)**: 10-shade inclusive classification system (MST-1 to MST-10)
- **Skin Tone Detection**: RGB-based classification using Euclidean distance matching
- **Adaptive Exposure**: Dynamic compensation ranging from -0.1 EV (lightest) to +0.6 EV (darkest)
- **Enhanced White Balance**: Progressive warmth adjustment to prevent grey/ashy appearance
- **Local Tone Mapping**: Shadow lift and highlight protection for detail preservation
- **Configurable Settings**: Full control over all processing parameters

### 2. User Interface Components

**File**: `src/components/RealTonePanel.js`

An interactive panel that displays:

- Real-Tone enable/disable toggle
- Detected skin tone category with color swatch
- Current exposure compensation being applied
- Full Monk Skin Tone Scale visualization with 10 color swatches
- Educational information about Real-Tone technology
- Active category highlighting

### 3. Camera Integration

**File**: `src/screens/CameraScreen.js` (modified)

Enhanced camera functionality:

- Real-time face detection for skin tone analysis
- Automatic MST category estimation
- Visual indicator showing Real-Tone status (green badge)
- Quick access to Real-Tone panel via ✨ button
- Seamless integration with existing camera controls
- Automatic application of optimized settings during capture

**File**: `src/components/CameraControls.js` (modified)

Added Real-Tone control button:

- ✨ sparkle icon for Real-Tone toggle
- Green highlight when active
- Integrated with existing camera controls

### 5. Testing and Validation

**File**: `__tests__/utils/RealToneProcessor.test.js`

Comprehensive Jest test suite with 40+ tests:

- Initialization and configuration tests
- MST classification for all 10 categories
- Exposure compensation calculations
- White balance tuning tests
- Local tone mapping validation
- Edge case handling
- Feature toggle testing

**File**: `scripts/validate-real-tone.js`

Manual validation script that demonstrates:

- Skin tone classification across all MST categories
- Exposure compensation for each category
- Optimized settings examples
- White balance progression
- Local tone mapping visualization
- Edge case testing
- Feature toggle validation

## Technical Highlights

### Monk Skin Tone Scale Implementation

```javascript
// 10-shade inclusive scale with progressive exposure compensation
MST-1 (Very Light):   -0.1 EV
MST-2 (Light):         0.0 EV
MST-3 (Light Medium): +0.1 EV
MST-4 (Medium):       +0.2 EV
MST-5 (Medium Tan):   +0.25 EV
MST-6 (Tan):          +0.3 EV
MST-7 (Deep Tan):     +0.35 EV
MST-8 (Dark):         +0.4 EV
MST-9 (Very Dark):    +0.5 EV
MST-10 (Deepest):     +0.6 EV
```

### Adaptive Processing

The implementation intelligently adjusts three key areas:

1. **Exposure Compensation**: Prevents underexposure of darker skin tones
2. **White Balance**: Adds warmth progressively to prevent ashy appearance
3. **Local Tone Mapping**: Lifts shadows while protecting highlights

### Classification Algorithm

Uses Euclidean distance in RGB color space to find the closest MST category:

```javascript
distance = √[(R₁-R₂)² + (G₁-G₂)² + (B₁-B₂)²]
```
