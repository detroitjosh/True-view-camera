## Project Vision

TrueView Camera aims to be the most inclusive camera application for mobile devices, with a particular focus on accurate and beautiful representation of darker skin tones. By combining computer vision, machine learning, and thoughtful design, we're building a camera app that works equally well for everyone.

**Core Principles:**
- **Inclusivity First**: Optimize for all skin tones, especially darker complexions
- **Privacy-Focused**: Local-first processing, transparent data handling
- **Open Source**: Community-driven development and transparent algorithms
- **Ethical AI**: Responsible use of AI technology with clear guidelines
- **Accessibility**: Usable by everyone, regardless of ability
